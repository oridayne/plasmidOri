NEW TODOS:
add new table element - annotationData
make clear what kinds of genes are annotated- new display for annotated genes?

TODOS:
- better UI for search list 
- test cases
- ATG end case handling
- other stop/start codons
- amino acid conversion
- move cursor to end upon enter 
- optimated toggle between full and partial editor
- disallow editing for annotation
- error handling for bad blast cases - job still pending, etc
- lag issues when getting blast results
- put back in controller for highligher
- get reverse complement working
- GET ENZYME MATCH TO WORK OVER THE CIRCULAR PROBLEM!
- allow user to disable or enable enzyme matching
- filter by enzyme type, length

blasting against database?
plasmapper
 - plasmapper auto annotation?
 list of common annotations to auto annotate?
 checkboxes/ask which ones?


 - single strand
 - use <, > for strand indicaton
 - highlighting/mismatch showing * - make this much easier to see
 - amino acid alignment*
 - fix ORF clicking on opposite direction
 - fix clicking when there is no lenght to ORF arrow (clicking on ends...)
 - reverse strand ORF checking
 - blast editor off by one on clicking green line
 - edge case when subject query has space mismatch

-think about hto - is it inclusive or exclusive?
